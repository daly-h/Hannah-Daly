I'm interested in understanding "E4" - energy/economy/environment/engineering - systems, specifically in using energy models to develop sustainable pathways for the energy system, encompassing energy access, climate change and air pollution. My research addresses energy systems at national and global levels, and I engage with policymakers, civil society and academia. As well as being a lead contributing author to several World Energy Outlook reports, I have co-authored around 20 journal articles and several book chapters and other reports.   

For an up-to-date list of my journal publications you can see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bCHKZxQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) profile. I publish other articles in the [Blog](/blog/) section of this website.

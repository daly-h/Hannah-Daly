I'm interested in understanding "E4" - energy/economy/environment/engineering - systems, specifically in using energy models to develop sustainable pathways for the energy system, encompassing energy access, climate change and air pollution. My research addresses energy systems at national and global levels, and I engage with policymakers, civil society and academia. As well as being a lead contributing author to several World Energy Outlook reports, I have co-authored around 20 journal articles and several book chapters and other reports.   

In UCC I am the co-PI of the Government-funded [CAPACITY project]{https://www.marei.ie/project/capacity/} which aims to enhance the evidence-base for Irish energy and climate policy development. I also supervise the Climate Change Advisory Council's Carbon Budgeting Fellow (2021-2023). 

For an up-to-date list of my journal publications you can see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bCHKZxQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) profile. I publish other articles in the [Blog](/blog/) section of this website.

I am on the editorial boards of the journals *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Transition* and *Energies* and act as reviewer for journals including Nature Climate Change, Nature Energy, Environmental Research Letters and Applied Energy.

I regularly do public engagement and speak on the Irish media about current topics on energy and climate change - see the Blog section of this website for details.

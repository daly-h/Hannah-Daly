#### Semester:
Semester 2

#### Module Objective:
To teach students about energy systems and how to model them. To introduce software packages for energy systems modelling.

#### Module Content:
Technical, environmental, economic and market modelling of energy systems. Modelling national energy demand and supply. Macro-economic top-down modelling and techno-economic bottom up modelling. Partial equilibrium and general equilibrium modelling. Decomposition and energy intensity analysis. Modelling renewable energy systems. Introduction to specific modelling tools and software packages, including a selection of: MATLAB Simulink, LEAP, RETScreen, SAM, MARKAL - TIMES and PLEXOS.

#### Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:
    - Model a country's energy demand and supply using a simulation methodology
    - Model wind turbine control using a computer software simulation tool
    - Determine the viability of a renewable energy project using RETScreen or SAM software
    - Demonstrate an understanding of the key steps undertaken by Eirgrid to model generation adequacy
    - Model electricity dispatch with a given demand and generation portfolio using PLEXOS
    - Explain the key features of macro-economic and techno-economic energy forecasting models
    - Generate energy forecasts using simple modelling based on energy intensity.

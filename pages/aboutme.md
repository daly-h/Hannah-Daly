I am a Lecturer (above the merit bar) in Sustainable Energy and Energy Systems Modelling at University College Cork. My research and lecturing focus on modelling and developing sustainable pathways for the energy system, encompassing energy access, climate change and air pollution, and I engage extensively with policymakers, civil society and academia on those topics. As well as being a lead contributing author to several International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook reports, I have co-authored over 20 peer-reviewed journal articles and several book chapters and other reports.

I'm affiliated with MaREI, the SFI Centre for Climate, Energy and the Marine and work closely with UCC's Energy Policy and Modelling Group. You can find out more about my [Teaching](/pages/teaching/) and [Research](/pages/research) on this website.

I am very lucky to live in beautiful West Cork at the gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way and to be the mother of two young girls.

*My comments were featured in interviews in the [Irish Examiner](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-40061198.html) and the [Sunday Business Post](https://www.businesspost.ie/analysis-opinion/ireland-on-road-to-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050-af909075).*


Today the Government published the long-awaited Climate Bill, a hugely significant step which puts in place the framework for a low-carbon economy.
Achieving this would put Ireland among the handful of countries who are legislating for a climate-neutral economy by 2050, which is required under our commitment to the Paris Agreement to limit long-term climate change.
The 2030 target, to halve emissions in a decade, was a core part of the Programme for Government and is unprecedented in national climate ambition. However, reference to this target is not in the draft Bill. Therefore it will be up to the Climate Change Advisory Council to set this ambition.
The legislation sets in place new governance and oversight to support our decarboniation ambition, which has been a significantly missing piece. It also provides the badly-needed long-term signal to the economy and society on future emissions.
However, I would not even go so far as to say that this document sets out the rules of the game – this sets out the objective and the process by which these rules will be set.
A  will be to enact hard policies to reduce our fossil fuel use, and reduce methane emissions from agriculture. EPA projections have indicated that to even meet the previous, less ambitious target for 2030 would require fully achieving the Climate Action Plan, which includes hugely ambitious targets for electric vehicles, home retrofits and renewable electricity. Policy is not in place to even meet these targets, and this new legislation does not indicate how the increased ambition for 2030 will be achieved.
It signals a significant step-up in ambition, but signals are not enough
It also does not give a strong signal to the need for reducing emissions from agriculture by allowing for the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane, without specifying a target for agriculture, which other countries like New Zealand have done.
Furthermore, the Bill sets out “legally-binding” carbon budgets but does not set forth what will happen if the budgets are not met – who is accountable?
The Bill has also dropped the plan to ban the sale of fossil fuelled vehicles by 2030.

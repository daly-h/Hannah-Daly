Pivot to online delivery... I planned to go online - prefer a carefully planned online delivery over the rush we had in March 2020, where we had only a few hours' notice to clear out our office and to become online teachers. I am very glad that I was not told that I would have to offer face-to-face teaching, like several colleagues were, because I could use the time to prepare properly rather than "pivot" again at the last minute.

I miss seeing students in person but many of these strategies has improved my overall teaching and I will use many tricks when life is back to normal.

## Lecture delivery
Pre-recorded Lectures
- fair on Students
- put on YouTube - not to everyone's taste but allows more people to learn - so why not?
- students can learn on their own time
-

## Assessment
Here are the following steps I have taken to try to reduce collusion in my weekly Canvas quizzes (after some research on remote assessment and Canvas’ features):
•	Students get a random sample of 10 multiple-choice questions from a “bank” of at least 20 questions available
•	They get two opportunities to do the quiz (so that if they get a low score the first time, and if they have time, they can review lecture material again and have a second attempt – but it will be another random selection of questions)
•	The questions and answers are randomised (so students at least can’t tell each other “answer to question 2 is option c)
•	The quiz is timed at 20 minutes (more than generous, according to feedback)
•	You can also programme random parameters for problem-based questions, so that each student gets a different problem
•	Each quiz starts with the question “I understand that while I am allowed to use both my course texts and any notes I've taken, this is not a collaborative test, and any work I submit must be mine alone and must be done without the input, help, or assistance of any other student. I also agree not to share questions or answers with any classmate.” – there is only one answer (“I agree”) and it’s worth zero marks. Studies show that this helps prevent cheating.
•	I give the answers to the full bank of questions at the tutorial each week and focus especially on the questions with a low score – but I don’t circulate a document with the answers (too easy to pass on to next year’s students).
•	It’s also possible to give extra time and attempts to certain students – I have used this option for those registered with DSS.
I have had positive feedback from students on this process and I think that it helps pace their progress for recorded lectures – otherwise they would be encouraged to cram at the end. I will also use Canvas’ TurnItIn feature for a written assignment and the open-book exam, which can show plagiarism and collusion. The designing of open-book assessment is a whole other area…

Other colleagues use Canvas quizzes as a "gate" for progression - students have an infinite time limit and number of attempts, but they can't progress to the next section of the course (or "module" in Canvas terminology) without getting past a certain standard in each quiz.  



notes
Open book is more reflective of real-world conditions and should be designed to have students demonstrate the application of their knowledge rather than summarising or recalling their knowledge
OU is moving away from unseen exams to lime limited assignments

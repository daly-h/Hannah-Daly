I spoke on [RTE Morning Ireland](https://www.rte.ie/radio/radio1/clips/22075980/) about the urgency of accelerating the clean and low energy transition in the face of the energy supply and climate crises.

The EU has spent €7bn on importing Russian fossil fuels since the war began. The Arctic & Antarctic are simultaneously seeing 30-40°C spikes in temperatures. Household energy bills are soaring.

The solution to all three issues is the same, and it’s not doubling down on fossil fuel use.

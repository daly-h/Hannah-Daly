*My comments were featured in interviews in the [Irish Examiner](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-40061198.html) and the [Sunday Business Post](https://www.businesspost.ie/analysis-opinion/ireland-on-road-to-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050-af909075).*

In summary:
1. A separate mandatory target for biogenic methane is strongly advised
2. A principle for setting intermediate targets is needed for consistency with Article 2 of the Paris Agreement
3. Scrutiny of climate policy analytical capacity is needed
4. I suggest that the overly-narrow term “climate neutral economy” should be replaced by “climate neutral society” or “climate neutral state”

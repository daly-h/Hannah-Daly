Two articles of the Paris Agreement are particularly relevant to countries as they seek to mitigate their impact on  global  warming.  Article  2  sets  a  target  for  long-term  temperature  stabilisation,  seeking  to  hold  the increase in global average temperature to “well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C”. Article 4 includes a target to “peak greenhouse gases (GHGs) as soon as possible” and thereafter to achieve “rapid reductions” in emissions so that sources of emissions are balanced  by  sinks  (i.e.  achieving  net  zero  emissions)  in  the  second  half  of  the  21st  century. Despite the ratification of the Paris Agreement, there is no political or scientific consensus on precisely how these targets should  be  translated  into  national  decarbonisation  trajectories.  As  a  result,  countries  are  developing  and setting their own carbon reduction strategies in different ways: increasingly, countries are implementing net-zero  targets  for  mid-century. Although consistent  with  Article  4,  given  the  linear  relationship  between warming  and  cumulative  net  emissions  of  long-lived  GHGs, net-zero  target  dates only specify  when temperatures  are  stabilised,  but  not  at  what  temperature. To  comply with  Paris  Agreement  temperature goals,  international  and  national  climate  action  policy  must  have  regard  to  cumulative  reductions  in  GHG emissions, not just single year targets. Broadly, this requires a carbon budget approach.  

In this discussion paper we review some of the ways that a carbon budget approach has been used in climate action policy. One approach is based on developing a so-called Climate Science Carbon Budget derived from a Global Carbon Budget (GCB) associated with a particular temperature goal and an equitable effort-sharing approach  to  share  the  GCB.  This  is  contrasted  with  other  approaches  including  national  frameworks  for climate policy such as the UK’s net zero emissions by 2050 where the carbon budgets are for a shorter time period (i.e. 5 years). We call this latter approach Climate Policy Carbon Budgets, that is carbon budgets that aren’t derived from a global temperature target, but instead from national decarbonisation trajectories. This discussion  paper also  explores  approaches  to  developing  decarbonisation  pathways  for  Ireland  which  are consistent with the Paris Agreement using a carbon budget approach. This discussion paper outlines a broad approach to generating a national long-term climate science carbon budget for Ireland and translating it into five-year sectoral carbon  budgets.  The  process  for  developing  such  carbon  budgets  will  require  an appropriate  set  of  robust  energy  system  modelling  tools,  that  are  iteratively  developed  and  examined, together with  an  extensive  stakeholder  engagement  process.  This  discussion  paper  concludes  with  some reflections on the governance arrangements for setting, monitoring, and reviewing carbon budgets.

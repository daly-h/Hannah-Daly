message: "@Matthew, thanks for your comments. To add a few clarifications, I am absolutely not implying that the science behind GWP* is dodgy, and I'm very familiar with the work and comments of people whose names you list. The fact is that methane from agriculture has been responsible for >35% of Ireland's global warming impact since 2011, when milk production has been rising (and that's measured with GWP*). Methane from dairy is most closely related to milk output - emissions per cow have actually grown by 15% since 1990, so the herd size is only part of the matter. Stabilised methane emissions, the target of the Ag Climarise strategy, would mean that CO2 emissions from energy would need to fall by 75% by 2030 to meet the Programme for Government target, which is likely to be reflected in EU law soon. The point of my article is to show that the target of stabilising methane emissions (the Ag Climatise plan) is not consistent with the Government's climate target, or indeed the Paris Agreement goals (which requires significant drop in CH4). \r\n\r\nI'm glad that new technologies you mention are being pursued. There is a very short window to actually achieve reductions in methane emissions and it remains to be seen whether these will actually be taken up and achieve the savings promised. Right now, there are very few incentives for farmers to take these up, which needs to change."

  Sorry but you seem to make out gwp* was made by climate deniers and big
  business with dodgy science. When chief author  is dr myles allen who was co
  author of ippc report on keeping below 2’c which many climate decisions have
  been made on the back of and isn’t currently on the council. Bbc credit him as
  physicist behind net zero and currently professor at Oxford. So he is most
  certainly someone with greater understanding of the subject and is reliable .
  He describes a constant herd with .3% decrease per annum as having no global
  warming impact. The department says stable methane which i imagine is satble
  herd in order to achieve what is set out by dr allen. In laymans terms he
  describes a constant herd as a closed coal factory once had a warming effect
  whenever that was but no longer does. Looking at it from a practical point of
  view an adoption of this would mean that if we were increased by 5% lets say
  it would mean that most of the herd would be in a constant and we could them
  identify where the increase are coming from and cull them or offset it for
  example. This metric would also state that Herd had a cooling effect if you
  understand (only drop of 20k to get us in line for 2020)You make it out to be
  this is highly controversial but people such as dr allen, michelle cain, in
  irish context Chairman of irish climate change council john fitzgearld, philip
  obrien epa and former member of climate council gerry boyle. None of whom say
  this is dodgy science. I assume you refer to Irish Farmers Journal as the ones
  who make it out to be get out of jail card but in their article they reiterate
  we must not be increasing herd. What ive said in the previously could be put
  down to jargon or misinterpretation which can happen and is only in minor
  details.You make no attempt in your article to offer any alternatives
  ,solutions. No mention of mixed species sward, stabiliser breeds,
  silvopasture, amp grazing and to look deeper than 30cm horizons for soil. Look
  up white oak pastures or niels olsen to show how farms can and have been
  scientifically proven to be carbon negative and in the case of white oak
  pastures out preforming other protein sources comfortably. If an 18 year old
  with only a junior cert can see an abundance of solutions surely someone with
  a doctorate in the field could. This attitude of showing fault but no
  practical solution wont solve anything

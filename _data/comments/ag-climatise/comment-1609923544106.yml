  Hi @Eugene, my specialty is in modelling climate mitigation pathways mainly
  for the energy sector. Just to add a few clarifications, the ambition for
  renewable electricity is very high - we are at nearly 40% of electricity from
  renewables at the moment and the target for 2030 is 70%, a very significant
  technical challenge which would be daunting to exceed. Every sector (including
  heat and transport, which make up the bulk of emissions from energy) has
  ambitious targets - the Climate Action Plan in 2019 lays down a roadmap.
  However, the government is aiming for even greater ambition for reducing
  emissions by 2030 than the Climate Action Plan, and the Ag-Climatise plan has
  not shown how the agriculture sector will contribute to this mitigation
  effort.

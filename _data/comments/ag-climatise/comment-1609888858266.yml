message: "I am sure you are specialists.? But if you ever attended a farmer’s meeting you might be asked some awkward questions, like - \r\nHow can Ireland keep Moneypoint (coal plant) open or have an electric mix @ 27 % renewable while the U.K. has already managed 33 %..\r\nOk, farming, a Martian visiting would conclude that the most efficient way to save energy, (or particularly Carbon) would be to allow the country with the best natural advantage produce the product. Ireland / New Zealand - dairy . Brazil - hardwood or tropical stuff. But, within Ireland you must first address “Land Use” .\r\nSpecifically; if you now have to double down on Methane: breeding - Irish milk yield is abysmally low by international (developed countries) standards. .\r\nI note some mention of stock bulls paying the price (but as a result) you end up with 20% of herd empty not a bright idea. \r\nFeeding - use Land Use policy to decrease intensity - but here’s the mother of all stupidity if you reduce Nitrogen fertiliser  (all the NO molecules) but , as a result import lots of feedstuff, you may simply  be “off - shoring “ Carbon to Brazil, which is devastating more forest to grow more soya .! \r\nBest case: wait until Israel and New Zealand develop feed additive  that actually works to neutralise Methane in ruminants or perhaps the Irish should be on the phone to them .!"

  What about methane oxidizing material found in soil. Do you think this will
  ever be looked at as looking at methane maps shows large concentration of
  methane coming from western china northern india and russia. all known for
  their pipelines and coal factories not large herds. then looking at sub
  saharan countries, new zeland, ireland and northern brazil (now they create a
  other environmental disaster but looking specifically at methane) these
  countries all have normal concentrations. would converting methane into co2
  and water vapor through masks over their nose which can be applied easily to
  grazing  ruminants help ireland achieve targets?  A soil carbon scheme with
  mixed species sward is as close to silver bullet as you will come by, this can
  counted against our methane emissions. this will probably be coming into eu
  carbon credit legislation when a fair accounting method is devised, as is in
  Australia. accounting our sequestration correctly (which hasnt been done) and
  improving it is how agriculture read carbon neutrality and should even further
  as it is the only sector that can. You still dont propose what should be
  written to achieve targets?

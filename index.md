I am a lecturer (above the merit bar) in Sustainable Energy and Energy Systems Modelling at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie), Ireland. My research and lecturing focus on modelling and developing sustainable pathways for the energy system, encompassing energy access, climate change and air pollution, and I engage extensively with policymakers, civil society and academia on those topics. As well as being a lead contributing author to several International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook reports, I have co-authored over 20 peer-reviewed journal articles and several book chapters and other reports.

### Career profile
*2019-present:* Lecturer in Sustainable Energy Systems, University College Cork. You can find out more about my [Teaching](/teaching/) and [Research](/research/) on this website. I'm affiliated with [MaREI](https://www.marei.ie), the SFI Centre for Climate, Energy and the Marine and work closely with UCC's Energy Policy and Modelling Group at UCC's [Environmental Research Institute](https://www.ucc.ie/eri).

*2015-2019:* Lead on energy access at the [International Energy Agency (IEA)](https://www.iea.org/), leading the topic of energy development for the World Energy Outlook (WEO), co-authoring the 2017 [Energy Access Outlook](https://www.iea.org/topics/energy-access) report.
